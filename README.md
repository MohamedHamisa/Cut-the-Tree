# Cut-the-Tree

There is an undirected tree where each vertex is numbered from 1 to n, and each contains a data value. The sum of a tree is the sum of all its nodes' data values. If an edge is cut, two smaller trees are formed. The difference between two trees is the absolute value of the difference in their sums.

Given a tree, determine which edge to cut so that the resulting trees have a minimal difference between them, then return that difference.
